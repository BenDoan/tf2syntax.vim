=============

Basic syntax for tf2 cfg files for Vim.

##Credits
Sumant Manne for original tf2.vim syntax highlighting project.

#Description
Trying to provide basic syntax highlighting for Team Fortress 2's .cfg files.
The current commands such as cl_interp, bind etc are all only temporarily in there
until I write a script to scrape the list of commands off of [the tf2 wiki](http://wiki.teamfortress.com/wiki/Console)
